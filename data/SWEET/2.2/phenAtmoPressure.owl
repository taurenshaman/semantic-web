The vorticity associated with a mesocyclone is often on the order of 10-2 s-1 or greater. (It should be noted that a mesocyclone is not just any cyclone on the mesoscale; it refers specifically to cyclones within convective storms.) Mesocyclones are frequently found in conjunction with updrafts in supercells. Tornadoes sometimes form in mesocyclones. Persistent mesocyclones that have significant vertical extent are detected by Doppler radar as mesocyclone signatures. Tornado warnings may be issued when a mesocyclone signature is detected.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A depression that forms within the monsoon trough. The term is most frequently used to describe weak cyclonic disturbances that form over the Bay of Bengal and generally track northwestward over the Indian subcontinent. These occasionally intensify into tropical cyclones if they remain over warm ocean water long enough. The term is also used to describe depressions that form within the monsoon trough near Australia and in the western North Pacific region. The term has gained ascendancy in use to refer to a broad tropical cyclonic vortex characterized by 1) its large size, where the outermost closed isobar may have a diameter on the order of 600 n mi (1000 km); 2) a loosely organized cluster of deep convective elements, which may form an elongated band of deep convection in the east semicircle; 3) a low- level wind distribution that features a 100 n mi (200 km) diameter light-wind core, which may be surrounded by a band of gales or contain a highly asymmetric wind field; and 4) a lack of a distinct cloud system center. Most monsoon depressions that develop in the western North Pacific eventually acquire persistent central convection and accelerated core winds, marking their transitions into conventional tropical cyclones.</rdfs:comment>

The rising portion of the reflectivity maximum is indicative of updraft, and the later descending portion is indicative of a precipitation downdraft.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A regular pattern of convective cells that can develop in an atmospheric boundary layer heated from below or radiatively cooled from cloud top. This phenomenon is readily observed in satellite imagery during cold air outbreaks when continental air passes over the relatively warm coastal ocean. Cloud lines, marking horizontal roll vortices, form initially in the developing marine atmospheric boundary layer. These lines evolve into open cells, which are defined by clouds in the upward motion along the edges of honeycomb- shaped cells, with less cloudy subsiding air in their centers. The convective structure further evolves into closed cells, which have cloudy centers and cloud-free edges.</rdfs:comment>

The diameter of the radar-detected rotation is 1?8 km. This is a relatively new storm type, the existence of which has been confirmed by data from the recently installed WSR?88D radars in the US. Mini-supercells occur in areas where the height of the equilibrium level is low, most often in the northern US, but possibly under certain weather conditions in any area of the world.

Initially, a subsequent regime exists in its core and western and northwestern quadrants with light winds and scattered low cumulus clouds; later, the area within the outer closed isobar may fill with deep convective cloud and become a isobar or tropical cyclone.

Convergence forms between upslope (or sometimes light and variable) flow at lower elevations of the lee slopes and downslope flow at higher elevations, which results from the downward convective mixing of ambient momentum from the flow above ridgetops. With moist upslope flow and favorable conditions, updrafts produced by the convergence can lead to mountain cumulus formation, or trigger thunderstorm or severe weather activity.</rdfs:comment>
