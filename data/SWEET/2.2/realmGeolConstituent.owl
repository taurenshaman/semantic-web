    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Constituent crystallized in crystallographic continuity with some other mineral constituent, typically quartz or calcite. In a clastic rock, commonly forms cement as well, but this should be represented using two role attribute links, 'overgrowth' and cement, because overgrowth does not necessarily imply cement.</rdfs:comment>

  </owl:Class>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#StructuralConfiguration">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#RockConstituent"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Constituent occurs in a structural configuration integral to the rock, such as layering, veinlets, overgrowths. The 'material' composition of these parts will often be other rock materials, not minerals, and  'ParticleGeometryDescription' associated with these describes the geometry of the constituent, not the particles the it is made of. These roles are mostly useful for RockMaterial descriptions that apply to individual samples, because their distribution is unlikely to be pervasive enought to be considered characteristic of a large mass of material.</rdfs:comment>
