    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MountainWind" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A strong, low-level wind through either a relatively level channel between two mountain ranges or a gap in a mountain barrier; originally applied to strong (10?20 m s-1) easterly winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Olympic Mountains of western Washington State and the mountains of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. There they have been defined as ?a flow of air in a sea level channel that accelerates under the influence of a pressure gradient parallel to the axis of the channel.? As in the case of mountain- gap winds, this term has also been applied to pressure-gradient winds accelerating through a gap in a mountain barrier. The pressure gradient often results from a stable, post-cold-frontal anticyclone approaching the barrier and being partially blocked (see blocking) as it ascends the barrier, except for the flow through the gap or channel. The tehuantepecer of Central America is a well- known gap wind by this definition. These flows have sometimes been referred to as jet-effect wind and canyon wind.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Haboob">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MesoscaleWind" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A strong wind and sandstorm or duststorm in northern and central Sudan, especially around Khartoum, where the average number is about 24 a year. The name comes from the Arabic word habb, meaning ?wind.? Haboobs are most frequent from May through September, especially in June, but they have occurred in every month except November. Their average duration is three hours; they are most severe in April and May when the soil is driest. They may approach from any direction, but most commonly from the north in winter and from the south, southeast, or east in summer. The average maximum wind velocity is over 13 m s-1 (30 mph) and a speed of 28 m s-1 (62 mph) has been recorded. The sand and dust form a dense whirling wall that may be 1000 m (3000 ft) high; it is often preceded by isolated dust whirls. During these storms, enormous quantities of sand are deposited. Haboobs usually occur after a few days of rising temperature and falling pressure.</rdfs:comment>

It is generally southerly or southeasterly, occurring in front of depressions moving eastward across North Africa or the southeastern Mediterranean. The deep khamsins occur in spring with depressions traveling east-northeast across the northern Sahara. They are preceded by a heat wave lasting about three days and are followed by a duststorm. The passage of the depression is marked by a cold front bringing Mediterranean air and a sudden drop in temperature. See ghibli, chili, sirocco.</rdfs:comment>

The knik wind blows most frequently in the winter, although it may occur at any time of year. In winter the knik winds are accompanied by very pronounced temperature rises; cases of more than 10?C in 24 hours have been observed. These winds may last from one to ten days. They result from a pressure gradient normal to the Chugach Mountains, causing a pronounced foehn effect in the Matanuska Valley.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Kossava">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MesoscaleWind" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">(Also spelled kosava, koschawa.) A cold, very squally wind, descending from the east or southeast in the region of the Danube ?Iron Gate? through the Carpathians, continuing westward over Belgrade, thence spreading northward to the Rumanian and Hungarian borderlands and southward as far as Nish. In winter it brings temperatures down to below -29?C and it is cool even in summer, when it is also dusty. It usually occurs with a depression over the Adriatic and high pressure over southern Russia, a frequent situation in winter. It is usually explained as a jet-effect wind through the Iron Gate, giving speeds well above the gradient wind, but J. K?ttner (1940) regards it rather as a katabatic wind intermediate between foehn and bora. The kossava has a marked diurnal variation, with its maximum occurring between 5 A.M and 10 A.M.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#KrakatoaWind">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MesoscaleWind" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">(Also spelled Krakatau; formerly called overtrades.) A layer of easterly winds over the Tropics at an altitude of about 18-24 km. This layer tops the midtropospheric westerlies (the antitrades), is at least 6 km deep, and is based at about 2 km above the tropopause. This easterly current is more prominent and better defined in the summer hemisphere. It derives its name from the observed behavior of the volcanic dust carried around the world after the great eruption of Krakatoa (6?S, 105?E) in 1883.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A wind, similar in origin to the sea breeze but generally weaker, blowing from the surface of a large lake onto the shores during the afternoon; it is caused by the difference in surface temperature of land and water as in the land and sea breeze system. In addition to area, the depth of the lake is an important factor; a shallow lake warms up rapidly and is less effective as the source of a lake breeze in summer than is a deep lake. Lake breezes are well developed around the Great Lakes of North America, where they temper the summer heat.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MesoscaleWind" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The Spanish and most widely used term for an east or northeast wind occurring along the coast and inland from southern France to the Straits of Gibraltar. It is moderate or fresh (not as strong as the gregale), mild, very humid, overcast, and rainy; it occurs with a depression over the western Mediterranean Sea. In summer it is rare and weak; in January it is inhibited by the Iberian anticyclone. It is most frequent from February to May and October to December. A levant (French spelling) with fine weather is a levant blanc; in the Roussillon region of southern France (where, as along the Catalonian coast of Spain, it is called llevant) it often brings floods in the mountain streams. The levanter of the Gibraltar Straits is a related phenomenon. Compare leste, lombarde, levantera.</rdfs:comment>

In the Rh?ne delta it blows also from the south. The marin is associated with depressions that cross southern France or northern Spain and the Gulf of Lions. Generally, it is strong and regular, sometimes violent and turbulent in hilly country as the ayalas in the Massif Central; it is very humid, cloudy with hill fog, and often rainy (unless unaccompanied by fronts, when it is the marin blanc). The heavy rains, which may continue for one or two days on the mountain slopes, cause dangerous river floods. On the western slope of the C?vennes it becomes the autan. In the southern C?vennes the marin is called the aygalas. On the coast of Catalonia (northeast Spain) and Roussillon (southern France) it is the marinada and generally occurs with a depression centered over or south of the Gulf of Gascony.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A mesoscale wind maximum. It typically may have an along-flow length scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers and a cross- flow length scale of 100 km. Mesojets differ from planetary-scale jets, which can have length scales of several thousand kilometers, and synoptic-scale jets, which may have length scales of 1000? 2000 km and are commonly found in association with progressive synoptic-scale troughs and ridges. Larger mesojets may also sometimes be known as jet streaks. Mesojets can form adjacent to prominent orographic features in association with terrain-channeled flow. Mesojets are also seen in association with organized mesocale convective systems as typified by the evaporatively driven rear-inflow jet commonly found behind active squall lines lines. Mesojets may also be found in conjunction with prominent lower-tropospheric stable layers where the airflow can become decoupled from the planetary boundary layer, especially at night. An exceptionally well organized lower-tropospheric mesojet extending over hundreds of kilometers might be known as a low-level jet.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A local wind blowing through a gap between mountains, a gap wind. This term was introduced by R. S. Scorer (1952) for the surface winds blowing through the Strait of Gibraltar. When air stratification is stable, as it usually is in summer, the air tends to flow through the gap from high to low pressure, emerging as a ?jet? with large standing eddies in the lee of the gap. The excess of pressure on the upwind side is attributed to a pool of cold air held up by the mountains. Similar winds occur at other gaps in mountain ranges, such as the tehuantepecer and the jochwinde, and in long channels, such as the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Olympic Mountains of Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
