    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice, always produced by convective clouds, nearly always cumulonimbus. An individual unit of hail is called a hailstone. By convention, hail has a diameter of 5 mm or more, while smaller particles of similar origin, formerly called small hail, may be classed as either ice pellets or snow pellets. Thunderstorms that are characterized by strong updrafts, large liquid water contents, large cloud-drop sizes, and great vertical height are favorable to hail formation. The destructive effects of hailstorms upon plant and animal life, buildings and property, and aircraft in flight render them a prime object of weather modification studies. In aviation weather observations, hail is encoded A.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A convective storm system usually composed of a cluster of ordinary convective cells at various stages of their life cycle. New cells within the convective system are generated primarily by either low-level convergence along a preexisting boundary, or by lifting at the leading edge of the system-scale cold pool that was produced by the previous cells. A multicell storm may have a lifetime of several hours, and may also have supercells incorporated as a part of the system as well.

 <owl:Class rdf:about="#FamilyOfTornadoes">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Tornado" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A sequence of long-lived tornadoes produced by a cyclic supercell storm. Tornadoes touch down at quasi-regular intervals (typically 45 min). Usually a new tornado develops in a new mesocyclone just after an old tornado has decayed in an old, occluded neighboring mesocyclone. Sometimes, two successive tornadoes may overlap in time for a few minutes. The two mesocyclones may rotate partially around each other. If the damage tracks of the tornadoes appear to form a wavy broken line, the family is classified as a series mode. In the more common parallel-mode family, the damage tracks are parallel arcs with each new tornado forming on the right side of its predecessor. The parallel mode is subcategorized into left turn and right turn, according to the direction in which the paths curve.</rdfs:comment>
