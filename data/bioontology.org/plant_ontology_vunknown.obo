comment: A lateral root primordium may arise from cells of a pericycle (PO:0006203) in a root, as in most seed plants (pericyclic lateral root primordium; PO:0025492), or from cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) or other tissue in ferns and some seed plants (non-pericyclic lateral root primordium: PO:0025493). Transition from lateral root primordium to lateral root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147), which can occur before the lateral root penetrates the exterior of the parent root.

comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

comment: May be dead at maturity. The secondary cell wall of a sclerenchyma cell is often thicker than other cell types in the same plant structure, but it is not always easy to distinguish from tracheary elements (PO:0000290) or sclerified parenchyma cells (PO:0000074). Compare with collenchyma cells (PO:0000075) that are always alive at maturity, have irregularly thickened primary cell walls, and do not have lignified secondary cell walls. Collenchyma cells provides flexibility while sclerenchyma cells provide hardness. Sclerenchyma cells include plant fiber cells (PO:0025407) and sclerid cells (PO:0025418).

Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system. Tracheary elements can be distinguished from fiber cells (PO:0025407) by the presence of bordered pits, although there are intermediate forms called fiber tracheids (PO:0000355).

comment: The stolon develops from an axillary bud and produces adventitious roots at the nodes and a terminal aerial stem. That stem then sends out one or more stolons from its axillary buds and the process is reiterated. A unique part of this process is that the first internode of a stolon is very long and then the shoot becomes an erect rosette.

comment: Libriform fiber cells have simple (unbordered) pits while fiber tracheids (PO:0000355) have bordered pits. Many intermediate forms exist and are generally classified as fiber tracheids (PO:0000355). If both libriform fiber cells and fiber tracheids are present, the libriform fiber cells usually have thicker walls. Libriform fiber cells have a slit-like aperture toward the cell lumen, but no pit cavity.

If annotating to a primordium of a floral structure, it is better to use the more specific term, such as petal primordium (PO:0000021) or anther primordium (PO:0006089).

comment: A root primordium may arise from cells of a pericycle (PO:0006203) in a root in most seed plant (pericyclic lateral root primordium; PO:0025492), from cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) in ferns and some seed plants (non-pericyclic lateral root primordium: PO:0025493), or from cells of a shoot axis (PO:0025029), in the case of a basal root primordium (PO:0025479) or shoot-borne root primordium (PO:0025480). Transition from root primordium to root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147).

Hydathodes are involved in the release of water or xylem sap through pores via guttation or secretion. Generally, hydathodes are located at the end of a minor vein in a phyllome. In many plants, hydathodes includes a portion of thin-walled parenchyma between the tracheary elements and the pore, known as an epithem. In some plants, hydathodes are associated with secretory tissue.

def: "An archesporial cell that is part of a megasporangium and divides to give rise to a megasporocyte." [PMID:10465788, POC:curators]
comment: Found in heterosporous ferns and seed plants. May also give rise to sterile cells. In the majority of flowering plants, including Arabidopsis, the female archesporial cell elongates and polarizes longitudinally, and directly differentiates into the megasporocyte or megaspore mother cell. In some flowering plants, it undergoes a periclinal division, and subsequently the inner cell differentiates into the megasporocyte.

def: "A whole plant fruit development stage (PO:0025500) that begins when the first fruit (PO:0009001) on a whole plant (PO:0000003) begins the process of ripening (GO:0009835) in a way which, in case there are other fruits, the majority of the other fruits start to ripen continuously therewith, and ends with earliest of the following: (1) the whole plant begins a sporophyte senescent stage (PO:0007017), (2) the whole plant begins a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), or (3) all fruits on the whole plant are finished ripening." [Poc:curators]
comment: Succeeds a whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042). This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant. For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). Although individual fruits are undergoing fruit ripening (GO:0009835), which is a type of senescence, during this stage, the whole plant is not yet undergoing multicelluar organism senescence (GO:0010259). An iteroparous species generally will have only one fruit ripening stage in its life, while a semelparous species may have multiple fruit ripening stage in its life. A whole plant fruit ripening stage may be followed by a sporophyte senescent stage, as in case (1) or by a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), as in case (2). In evergreen species and species that fruit multiple times during a growing season, a plant may have multiple fruit development stages without entering dormancy or senescence, as in case (3). In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) has ended. In some plants, fruit may continue to ripen after the whole plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage and left the whole plant fruit ripening stage. Some plants may never enter a whole plant fruit ripening stage, because fruits only begin to ripen after the plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage. Although the use of synonyms like "10-dough stage in sorghum" properly refer to the development of an individual fruit, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The sporophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the sporophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the sporophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. The sporophyte senescent stage may succeed the sporophyte reproductive stage in monocarpic plants that die after reproducing, such as annuals. This stage is distinct from sporophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant (PO:0000003). For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit development stage (PO:0001002). An iteroparous plant will only have one fruit formation stage in its life,  while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit formation stages during its life. In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the fruit ripening stage of whole plant (PO:0007042) has begun. Although the use of synonyms like "07-milk stage in rice" properly refer to the development of an individual fruits, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the sporophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of a seed, bud, or other plant structure. Dormancy of a plant may be preceded by the senescence of its parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system herbaceous perennials and by the formation of dormant buds. The end of dormancy in a sporophyte is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a sporophyte dormant stage are the resurrection plants Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and Craterostigma plantagineum (an angiosperm) while they are dessicated, and deciduous woody plants and herbaceous perennials or biennials that have a dormant stage in response to drought or cold.

comment: In some cases, a gynoecium (PO:0009062) may consist of only one carpel, in which case annotations should go on carpel (PO:0009030). The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium, but if a gynoecium consists of a single carpel, then pistil may be used synonymously with carpel. If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

If annotating gene expression to an androecium with a single stamen (PO:0009029), the annotation should go on stamen.

The development of an androecium in an ear floret of a normal maize plant is aborted and is present in a rudimentary state, while the development of an androecium in a tassel floret leads to a functional androecium.

comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: Common in monocots, including species of Poaceae such as Zea mays. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352). In Zea mays, development of the gynoecium ridge of the upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear occurs via continued overgrowth of the shoot apex (which becomes the ovule primordium) by a ring of gynoecial tissue, leading to the formation of a stylar canal that is detected as a slight protuberance on the mature ovary. Early development of the gynoecium ridge of the lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear is very similar to that of the upper floret of the pedicellate spikelet of ear, except the development does not proceed beyond the early ridge stage.

def: "A plant sperm cell (PO:0000084) that is part of the pollen (PO:0025281)." [PMID:20298228, POC:curators]
comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: May function in providing nutrition to developing sporocytes or pollen. May have one or more layers of cells. May break down as spores mature. A tapetum does not develop in some plants, such as Psilotum. In angiosperms, the tapetum develops from one of the parietal layers. In non-seed plants, the tapetum may develop from the outer cells of archesporium or from the inner-most layer of the sporangium wall.

comment: A unifacial leaf may be round in cross-section (terete) or it may be laminar (ensiform), in which case lamina development is in a median plane (perpendicular to the axis), rather than a transverse plane (tangent to the axis). Unifacial leaves may be bifacial at the leaf base. Many unifacial leaves develop by reduced (or absent) activity of the marginal meristems and increased activity of the adaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an adaxial surface (e.g., Acacia phyllodes). However, some develop by increased activity of the abaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an abaxial surface. Note that unifacial leaves may have two sides, as in ensiform leaves, but both sides arise from the same surface of the leaf meristem (abaxial or adaxial).

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the gametophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of other plant structures. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a gametophyte dormant stage are the moss Polytrichum commune after it has undergone dessication (a type of resurrection plant), the boreal moss Polytrichum alpestre, whose shoot systems have annual growth segments due to a period of dormancy during the winter, the female gametophyte of Ginkgo biloba, which is dormant before fertilization, and dormancy of plant spores.

This stage is distinct from gametophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: Found in cacti and other succulents. The upper part of a leaf from which a tubercle develops is usually shed early in development. Tubercles are often conical, but they may merge with those directly above and below to form ribs, as in saguaro (Carnegiea), or they may elongate, as in species of pincushion cacti (Mammillaria). In species with tubercles, the areole bud (PO:0025353) is often found at the distal end of the tubercle. The areole bud originates in the leaf axil (PO:0009023) of the leaf that becomes the tubercle, but is displaced to the tip through elongation of the tubercle.

comment: Aids plant in climbing. May be branched, may have adhesive disks at its distal end, may be woody, and may bear small leaves. A stem apex tendril differs from a branch tendril in that it arises from the shoot apical meristem, rather than in an axil. However, a shoot apex tendril may arise either from the apex itself, in which case it is terminal, or from the side of an apical meristem, in which case it is a lateral structure. In the latter case, the main stem of the plant undergoes sympodial growth. A stem apex tendril is often located on the opposite side of a stem from a leaf at the same node, as in Vitaceae.

def: "A seed development stage during which a seed participates in a seed dormancy process." [GO:0010162, POC:curators]
comment: A seed dormancy process (GO:0010162) is a dormancy process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken in a seed. Seed dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth in a seed, including the embryo contained therein, that can be reactivated. It often requires special conditions for reactivation, such as specific temperature, scarification, or leaching of inhibitors. Seed dormancy includes dormancy of the embryo and the seed coat, although\nthese may not begin or end simultaneously. Not all seeds go through a seed dormant stage. Most seeds that go through a dormant stage do so only one time.

def: "A portion of meristem tissue (PO:0009013) that is found on the adaxial side of a developing phyllome (PO:0006001)." [POC:curators]
comment: Contributes to the thickness of a phyllome (PO:0006001). There are two types of adaxial meristems. In phyllomes with a petiole (PO:0020038) and lamina (PO:0025060), an adaxial rounding meristem occurs later in development, is separated from the apical meristem (PO:0020144), and contributes to the thickness of the petiole and midrib. In unifacial phyllomes, the an adaxial meristem occurs earlier in development, is close to but separate from the apical meristem, and contributes to the thickness and cross-sectional shape of the entire phyllome. If annotating to a leaf, use the more specific term leaf adaxial meristem (PO:0025401).

[POC:wood_curators]
comment: During a secondary xylem development stage (also called a wood development stage), the cells of secondary xylem (PO:0005848), including tracheary elements (PO:0000290), xylem fiber cells (PO:0000274), and wood parenchyma cells (PO:0004525) undergo cellular developmental processes (GO:0048869) such as cell division (GO:0051301), cell growth (GO:0016049), cell differentiation (GO:0030154), or cell death (GO:0008219). The transition from sapwood to heartwood marks the end of the secondary xylem development stage.

comment: Functions in storage. This term should be used for tubers derived from roots (PO:0009005), as found in Cassava or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), not for tubers derived from branches (PO:0025073), as found in potatoes and yams. Use the term shoot axis tuber (PO:0004543), aerial tuber (PO:0004548), or subterranean tuber (PO:0004547) for tubers derived from branches. A tuberous root tuber may be distinguished from a tuber that is derived from a branch by the presence of a root cap (PO:0020123) early in development, or the presence of lateral roots (PO:0020121) or their remnants. Sometimes tuber roots bear vegetative buds (PO:0000058) like a tuber derived from a branch. A tuberous root tuber usually develops from a shoot-borne root (PO:0000042) or a lateral root (PO:0020121).

[POC:curators]
comment: A whole plant fruit development stage begins with the beginning of whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) and ends with the end of a whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010). A whole plant fruit development stage can be thought of as a fruiting cycle for a whole plant that begins when the plant starts to produce fruit and ends when all of the fruit on the plant are ripe, unless the plant enters a sporophyte senescent stage or sporophyte dormant stage before all the fruit is ripe. An iteroparous plant will have a single whole plant fruit development stage during its life of whole plant (PO:0025337), while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit development stages during its life, each of which will be part of the same instance of a sporophyte reproductive stage. Some plants retain their fruit after ripening and through dormancy, and thus may begin a new whole fruit development stage while fruits from the previous whole plant fruit development stage are still present.

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophyte development stage but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002). A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophyte development stage, but not in the case of apospory. A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exist by death at any point in its development. In seed plants, the whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exists through transformation, such as when pollen (PO:0025281) releases its pollen sperm cells (PO:0025121) or when a plant embryo (PO:0009009) begins to develop within an embryo sac (PO:0025074) of an angiosperm. During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes (PO:0025006) by mitosis.

def: "A portion of chlorenchyma tissue that develops directly from a spore and grows by division of an apical cell to form filaments that are one cell wide and dichotomously branching." [POC:Ramona_Walls]
comment: The protonema is the first structure that develops in the gametophytic phase of mosses, some other bryophytes, and leptosporangiate ferns. The term protonema is also used to refer to the phase of development in which protonemal tissue is produced (see PO:0030006 protonema phase). In some species of moss, the protonema is perennial. A protonema may develop from sporophytic tissue during apospory.

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

comment: Found in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. In mosses, the foot is located below the seta. In ferns, the foot is formed from the upper hypobasal quandrant of the embryo. The sporophyte foot serves for both attachment and absorption. The outer portion of the foot is composed of absorptive transfer cells.

comment: When an archegonium occurs on a specialized lateral branch of the gametophore, all of the phyllomes on that branch are usually perichaetal bracts. If an archegonium occurs on a main axis of the gametophore, only the terminal phyllomes are usually perichaetal bracts. The two or three terminal-most perichaetal bracts may fuse to form a gametophytic perianth.

comment: Found in bryophytes. The spore capsule calyptra is a membranous or hairy cap or hood, composed of gametophytic tissue (venter; PO:0030038) that protects the embryonic sporophyte within the archegonium (PO:0025126). In some species, it may persist after the sporophyte develops and gets carried upward as the seta (PO:0030032) elongates. The spore capsule calyptra is usually lost before the spores are released, and its shape can be used for identification purposes.

def: "A portion of plant tissue that is the outer layer or layers of a sporangium early in sporangium development." [ISBN:0962073342]
comment: Term used for bryophytes. May have one or more layers. An amphithecium may give rise to an exothecium and other layers of a sporangium wall (jacket layer or layers). In true mosses, the amphithecium gives rise to the sporangium wall and the peristome. In hornworts and peat mosses, it gives rise to the sporangium wall and sporogenous tissue.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.
